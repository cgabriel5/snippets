## § Read Before Use
1. Make sure to remove the `.gitignore` file from the `img/` directory before using. The file is used as a placeholder to include the otherwise empty folder with `Git`.
2. Remove setup sections (§) from the `README` after reading and fully understanding what to do.
3. Boilerplate uses `NodeJS`, `Gulp`, and `Yarn`. *Please make sure they are installed*.

## § Yarn Setup
Run the following commands in the following order:
1. `$ yarn init` &mdash; Update `package.json` as needed.
2. `$ yarn install` &mdash; Installs needed `package.json` modules.

## § Using Gulp
1. `$ gulp` &mdash; Runs the `default` command. This command runs the `build` and `watch` commands. Creating the needed folders/files, starts `browser-sync` servers, & watches project for file changes.
2. `$ gulp build` &mdash; Builds the needed folders/files for the app.
3. `$ gulp watch` &mdash; Watches project for file changes. Running the needed tasks to rebuild files.
4. `$ gulp reset -t/--type [req:str]` &mdash; Resets project to its original, downloaded "factory" state.
    * `$ gulp open -t main` &mdash; Resets the main directory, `/.`, using the `source/` directory as its source of files.
    * `$ gulp open -t backup` &mdash; Resets the `source/` directory using the `./` as its source of files.
5. `$ gulp open -p/--port [req:num] -f/--file [req:str]` &mdash; Will open the given file at the given port in browser.
    * `$ gulp open -p 3000 -f index.html` &mdash; Will open `index.html` at port `3000`.
    * `$ gulp open -p 3002 -f readme.md` &mdash; Will open `index.html` at port `3002`.
6. `$ gulp purify -D/--del [?flag-only] -r/--remove [?flag-only]` &mdash; Will purify CSS of any unused CSS.
    * `$ gulp purify` &mdash; Will create `pure.css` and **only** scan for any unused CSS.
    * `$ gulp purify -D` &mdash; Will delete `pure.css` file.
    * `$ gulp purify --remove` &mdash; Will delete `pure.css` **and** remove unused CSS from `/css/source/styles.css`.
7. **Modify** `gulpfile.js` as desired.
8. **Note** &mdash; The `$ gulp reset` command uses the `source/` directory to reset the project to its original state. Changes made to this folder will be transferred over when the command is used. Therefore, changes to `source/` are not recommended.

## § Files To Modify
1. **CSS** &mdash; Modify `css/source/styles.css`. `Gulp` will handle auto-prefixing, minifying, and concatenation.
2. **JS-App** &mdash; Modify `js/source/modules/*.js` files. `Gulp` will handle file concatenation, minifying, and beautification.
3. **JS-Libs** &mdash; Add third-party libraries to `js/libs/`. Then make sure to update the `jslibs` `Gulp` task by adding the library path file to the `src` array. `Gulp` will handle file concatenation, minifying, and beautification.
4. **HTML** &mdash; Modify `html/source/i*.html` files. `Gulp` will handle file concatenation, minifying, and beautification.
