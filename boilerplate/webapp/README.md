# Read Before Use
1. Make sure to remove the `.gitignore` file from the `img/` directory before using.
2. Only modify the `css/main/styles.css` file. Grunt tasks will handle auto-prefixing, minifying, and concatenation.
3. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install the modules specified in `package.json`.
4. Modify `package.json` `{{****}}` with updated information. Or with `npm init`.
5. Run `grunt` in the terminal to build the `dist/` directory.
5. Run `grunt watch` in the terminal to watch for any development changes.
    * Look in `Gruntfile.js` to see the names of individual tasks if needed to run individually. 
    * Modify `Gruntfile.js` as needed.
6. Remove this section (`Read Before Use`) from the `README` after reading this.
